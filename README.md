# SMU PCWEB3 Assignment

Welcome to the SMU PCWEB3 Assignment project! This repository contains the code and resources for an interactive online quiz application developed using PHP, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The quiz is designed to provide users with a fun and engaging way to test their knowledge on various topics.

## Features

1. **Randomized Quiz Questions**:
   - Each time a user refreshes the page, one of three different sets of quiz questions is randomly selected. This feature allows users to take the quiz multiple times with different questions, enriching the learning experience and adding an extra level of challenge.

2. **Interactive Quiz Interface**:
   - The quiz interface is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, thanks to the use of Bootstrap for styling. This ensures that the quiz can be accessed on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

3. **Instant Feedback and Results**:
   - Upon submitting the quiz, users are redirected to a results page where they can view their score. This page also provides detailed feedback on each question, allowing users to review their answers and learn from any mistakes.

4. **Dynamic and Secure Backend**:
   - The backend of the application is powered by PHP, ensuring that quiz data is processed efficiently and securely. The use of PHP allows for dynamic generation of quiz questions and seamless handling of user inputs.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: Server-side scripting language used to handle quiz logic and data processing.
- **HTML**: Markup language used to structure the quiz interface and web pages.
